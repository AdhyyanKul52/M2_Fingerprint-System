# INTRODUCTION

A fingerprint may be a group of data which will be wont to detect the software, network protocols, operating systems, or hardware devices. Finger print based security system are often used at many places like Industries, Offices, and Colleges or maybe at our home. Fingerprint sensor is that the main a part of this technique .It is also called as Biometric sensor. User has got to place his/her finger on the optical sensor a part of fingerprint module.

# WHAT


Fingerprint based security system is that the most fasten system as compared to other systems. Reason is that RFID card or Keys of lock are often stolen, password could also be leaked. However thumbnail of each person is exclusive , so lock won't open unless an equivalent person is present to offer the impression of fingerprint.

# WHY


Because it is contemplate as one of the safest method to lock or unlock any system as it can recognize anyone very uniquely and cannot be copied anyone.

# WHEN


20/04/22

# WHERE

It is used in many different fields and organizations, for example in recognizing the ID of a criminal and for other security purpose also.

# HOW
Fingerprint systems work by identifying the pattern of ridges and valleys on a finger. As a finger rests on the touch-capacitive surface, the device estimate the charge; ridges exhibit a change in capacitance, while valleys produce practically no change in the least . The sensor uses all this data to accurately map prints.

# SWOT ANALYSIS

# STRENGTH
Very fexible and easy to use.
It reduces the comlexity of authentication process.
It help investigators to link one crime scene to another involving the same person.

# WEAKNESS
Data acquisition and data storage signifies the main obstacle.
Possibility of system failure.

# OPPURTUNITIES
Security concerns growth bu consumers result in high demand for fingerprint systems.

# THREATS
New advanced tecnologies could challenge this technology.
Duplication of tecnology by rival companies.
